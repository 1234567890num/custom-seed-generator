# Custom Seed Generator

This tool is used with the Garden of Assemblage mod to customize specific rewards and aspects of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix.
It will create a custom pnach file that can be put in the cheat folder of PCSX2 alongside the GoA mod pnach, applying all of the customizations to the game.
This will let you make a planned out instance of a randomized seed (or a plando for short).

## How To Use

Each page has its own rules for how to customize and change rewards and equipment.
Checking rows and clicking replace will modify that reward in game.
Clicking vanilla instead will have the reward be exactly how it is in the regular game.
Anything that will end up being replaced in the game will be shown as a green row.
Anything that may cause crashes or issues in game will be shown as a red row.
Red rows will still be generated to use as described but use at your own risk.
After all rewards are modified to your liking, the save button will download a pnach file ready to be used.

### Saving / Loading Data

By clicking the save data button, a json file will be generated storing all the data of the current session.
Whenever loading up the site again, select the downloaded json file.
This will bring up all the modified values from the previous session.
It is unrealistic for me to promise this feature works perfectly.
If any issues come up let me know and be sure not to delete the json file even if it does not seem to work.

## Things to be Implemented

#### Randomize

I would love to implement the same random seed generation that val's site uses.
Essentially replace whatever you want, and then randomize everything else.
I want it to still kind of be compatible with Val's site where any replacements are either tracked or treated as junk.

#### Look and Feel

Site legit looks like butt so any ideas or thoughts to improve it would be super awesome.
I've mostly been focused on functionality so actual visuals are hard to do.

#### General Requests

Is there a crucial element missing?
Let me know and I'll do my best to implement it or see any limitations!
